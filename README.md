## Description

This repository contains the files to simulate a basic **Unix Shell** with its respective commands. It uses the POSIX API to implement many of the same functionalities of the first Ken Thompson's Shell and its made to carry out the **0x16. C - Simple Shell** project at [ALX SE.](https://www.alxafrica.com/ "ALX Africa.")

This simple shell is a Shell interface written in the `C` programming language that gives to the user a prompt `$` and executes a user inputted command. The shell is used directly to interact with the Kernel that hosts the OS. 

## Requirements:

* Operating System: [Ubuntu 14.04 LTS](http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/)

* Compiler: [GCC 4.8.4](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.8/)
